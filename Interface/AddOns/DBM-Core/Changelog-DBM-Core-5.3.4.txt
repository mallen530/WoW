	- Omega via svn r9864: more 5.4 prep Plus some reduced calls that were redundant and inefficient.
	- Omega via svn r9863: change that icon to star. my guild uses skull and x as kill targets on this fight, i imagine others do as well.
	- oscarucb via svn r9862: add an icon on Dark Animus Anima Font target
	- Omega via svn r9861: comment out bad CIDs
	- Omega via svn r9860: TOC is still 50300 in 5.4, so have to use a diff method for checking Add pandaria mods for 5.4
	- Omega via svn r9859: small fix for non heroic. so bouncing bolt and diffusion countdowns always enabled, cause in non heroic it's impossible to have both at same time.
	- ultrashining via svn r9858: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r9857: fix logic fail in SoO loading
	- Omega via svn r9856: Ahune now has INSTANCE_ENCOUNTER_ENGAGE_UNIT event so switch it to combat (besides, the say was removed apparently.) Update timer, they have changed somewhat.
	- Omega via svn r9855: #fix a flaw in lei shen mod where it disabled timers and range frame during intermission on heroic if a conduit is overloaded. no abilities are ever disabled during intermission on heroic. #Also fix it opening range frame to 6 (instead of 8) on heroic after intermission if diffusion chain is overloaded.
	- Omega via svn r9854: #improve conduit bars some. add timer for first conduit of phase 1 and phase 2 (obviously a generic bar as which conduit that is is determined after bar starts) #Fix countdown for diffusion and bouncing bolt so that they work like this: *If using diffusion strat, play sounds on both diffusion and bouncing when only one of either one is up. if BOTH are active, prefer the countdown for diffusion conduit. *if using bouncing strat, play both when solo, prefer bouncing count when both are active. #Improved spread warning to only go off if there is an actual spread. also made it filter cast target so it only announces the spreads (since cast target is already announced in other warning)
	- Omega via svn r9853: there is no 12345, so lets use Joe's god mode
	- Omega via svn r9852: add countdown for diffusion. shouldn't have it and bouncing at same time, ever. so kolt voice good here too
	- Omega via svn r9851: more test stuff
	- Omega via svn r9850: some testing
	- Omega via svn r9849: fix another error
	- Omega via svn r9848: better ptr fix
	- Omega via svn r9847: add buff active timer for mass spell reflect
	- Omega via svn r9846: fix another Lei shen bug
	- Omega via svn r9845: fix a messup
	- Omega via svn r9844: revert 45 sec change for phase 3. unfortunately it's not quite that simple. todo, see if i can auto correct timers mid fight. they are still 40 second cds but a lower cast priority than thunderstruck, lightning whip and balls. as such, often delayed by 1-5 seconds which is why seeing 45 second spacing is common (but not a guarentee)
	- Omega via svn r9843: Fix couple holiday bosses
	- Omega via svn r9842: Lei shen updates: Add optional warning (off by default) to announce diffusion spread targets Add mass spell reflect helper warnings Change gorefriends grasp warnings to count warnings
	- Omega via svn r9841: it appears for mods that require combat detection, setzone is required, so be it. world bosses will setzone the entirety of pandaria, kalimdor, eastern kingdoms and outlands. they register events in combat anyways
	- Omega via svn r9840: This should fix nalak and plants
	- Omega via svn r9839: This should fix pull timers, and maybe world boss behaviors too
	- Omega via svn r9838: refix world bosses, have to use mod:SetZone(DBM_DISABLE_ZONE_DETECTION) not just remove it
	- Omega via svn r9837: small code refactor so SetMapToCurrentZone isn't called more than needed.
	- Omega via svn r9836: Fixes to last, tested working now.
	- Omega via svn r9835: move zone change event handlers to range frame, only register them when needed.
	- Omega via svn r9834: remove setzone from outdoor encounters, since it won't work with new method. most of them should only register events in combat anyways.
	- Omega via svn r9833: ##F*ck the map. ##(All map based loading has been deleted!!!. All mods are now loaded using new method only.)
	- Omega via svn r9832: Fix crypt of kings bug causing relentless warnings not to work Added fear and guardian strike warnings for Maragor
	- ultrashining via svn r9831: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r9830: double frequency of crashing thunder warning
	- Omega via svn r9829: add synced check to that
	- Omega via svn r9828: ignore boss pulls in world if you aren't in combat. seeing nalak pulled/wiped in an endless loop cause a guildy is fighting nalak when i'm not is annoying.
	- Omega via svn r9827: add a trivial check method. gonna be refining old mods for things like "standing in crap" to choose whether or not to warn based on this check. abilities become irrelevant at a certain point and people want to run old mods without warnings yelling at 90s telling em they should move out of that fire that's doing like 500 damage per second to their 1Million HP health pool :)
	- Omega via svn r9826: kill infinite loop, that part of debug not necessary, just nil check should fix problem
	- Omega via svn r9825: not sure why "addmsg" is a nil value, so change them to prints, addmsg almost never works when i try to use it.
	- Omega via svn r9824: Add some stuff, reference http://elitistjerks.com/f104/t132814-lua_error_lfr_tot_zone/
	- Omega via svn r9823: Missed couple special warnings
	- Omega via svn r9822: more counts on lei shen. Reset counts on phase 3 start.
	- Omega via svn r9821: Fix phase 3 heroic pillar timers. (they are 45 here, not 40)
	- ultrashining via svn r9820: zhTW update
	- Omega via svn r9819: seems working but needs throttle
	- Omega via svn r9818: lets try again to make this tank debuff work on lei shen
	- Omega via svn r9817: fix a div by 0 on ptr do to blizz bug
	- Omega via svn r9816: Some twin consorts requests
	- Omega via svn r9815: Hopefully fix dark parasite warning on durumu
	- ebmor via svn r9814: deDE update
	- ebmor via svn r9813: deDE update
	- tandanu via svn r9812: increment version number for alphas
